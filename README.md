Slime Mold Simulation - Interactive Evolution

Started with @pattvira's amazing Physarum tutorial and took it to the next level! This interactive slime mold simulation now features:

âœ¨ What I added: â€¢ Click anywhere to drop food and watch the molds swarm â€¢ Realistic boundary physics - no more teleporting through walls â€¢ Smart clustering behavior - molds spread in 360Â° patterns when overcrowded â€¢ Video recording system - capture your creations with one keypress â€¢ Enhanced food system with consumption and regeneration

The organic patterns that emerge are absolutely mesmerizing! ðŸŒ€

Starting from a single point, these 5000 digital organisms create complex networks as they search for food, cluster together, and then explosively disperse when things get too crowded.

ðŸ”¬ Built with p5.js and lots of computational biology inspiration ðŸŽ¥ Press 'S' to record your own slime mold videos!
